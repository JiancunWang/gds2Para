# gdsii-interface
GDSII File Parser and Plotter (deprecated branch)

This GDSII file parser is written in C++ as part of a wider API for the electromagnetic design validation of VLSI designs. The code design follows a philosophy intended to have the most extensibility and highest level of automation possible for increasingly complex integrated circuits. Please carefully read this **README.md** file for installation and usage instructions
